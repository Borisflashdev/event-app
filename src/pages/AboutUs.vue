            <h1>Who are We?</h1>
            <p>
                Craft Ontario is a registered charitable organization under the legal name Ontario Crafts Council 
                (118878511RR0001), founded in 1976 as a merger between the Canadian Guild of Crafts (1931) and the Ontario 
                Craft Foundation (1966). Based in Toronto since its inception, Craft Ontario currently offers programs and 
                services to 1300 members across Ontario, 1000 of which are professional craft artists, businesses, galleries, 
                guilds and organizations. As a multi-disciplinary craft organization devoted to the support, advocacy and promotion
                of Ontario craft and craft artists, Craft Ontario operates in four parts: (1) as an art service provider, (2) 
                presentation space, (3) publisher, and (4) retailer.Our services and programs provide support for craft artists
                at all career levels, while raising awareness of, providing access to, and growing appreciation for their work.
                Craft Ontarioâ€™s primary areas of focus include: member services and professional development programming, 
                including workshops, conferences and the annual awards program; exhibitions that contextualize and present
                contemporary craft practice to the public; the Craft Ontario Shop, a retail presentation space that provides 
                opportunities for members to sell their work; and the nationally-distributed Studio magazine, which fosters 
                critical dialogue in the Canadian craft and design community. Craft Ontario further contributes to craft on
                both a national and international level through partnering with other craft-related organizations to advocate
                for craft practice and produce special projects that include touring exhibitions, residencies and symposia.

            <h1>Our Plan</h1>
            <p>
                Craft Ontario's most significant contribution to the cultural community is the support of craft artists
                 by providing tools to develop their careers and make an income from their work, promoting their work 
                 through exhibitions, retail, online and print publications, and through advocating for the importance 
                 of craft practice as an integral part of contemporary culture. At the same time, Craft Ontario's programs
                 and services foster a community of patrons, collectors and educators, which continues to grow through an 
                 engaged public that actively seeks to understand the value in supporting craft.
